<p> Delicious Fried Eggplant (Pritong Talong) </p>
<h> Ingredients </h>
<ul> 
    <li> 1 large Chinese eggplant </li>
    <li> 6 tablespoons cooking oil  </li> 
    <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour  </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons bagoong alamang  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Slice the eggplant in half lengthwise. Cut into 3 inch pieces.
</li> 
    <li>Dredge the eggplants in flour. </li> 
    <li> Heat 4 tablespoons oil in a pan. Once the oil gets hot, pan-fry the eggplant slices until one side gets dark brown. Turn it over to cook the other side. Add the remaining oil if necessary since eggplants tend to absorb oil when fried. Continue to cook until the eggplant is done.
